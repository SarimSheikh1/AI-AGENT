I hope you're having a productive week.

I'm working on the final review for the Q3 Project Report and had a quick question about the data in Section 2. The figures seem a bit lower than our initial forecasts. Could you provide a brief explanation or point me to the notes on that?

No huge rush, but by tomorrow EOD would be great.

Thanks,

Alex
